# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of software engineering skills.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. These puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th and are intended to challenge and improve your coding skills in a fun and festive way. I choose to solve these puzzles in Python.

## Structure of the Repository

Each day's challenge is placed in a separate directory named `DayXX`, where `XX` is the day of the challenge. Each directory contains:

- The puzzle description in a `README.md` file.
- Input data for the challenge in an `input.txt` file.
- Solution scripts for each part of the day's challenge.
- Any additional notes or documentation in a `NOTES.md` file.
