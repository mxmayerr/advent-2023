## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. These puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th and are intended to challenge and improve your coding skills in a fun and festive way. I choose to solve these puzzles in Python.

## Structure of the Repository

Each day's challenge is placed in a separate file named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day of the challenge. It is important to note that some files are setup for their part 2 solutions, so just check the comments as you're reading.
